        "    - **Place cells** in the hippocampus fire when an animal is in a particular location.\n",
        "    - **Grid cells** in the entorhinal cortex fire in a hexagonal grid pattern across the environment.\n",

        "    - **Head direction cells** in the thalamus fire when an animal is facing a particular direction.\n",
        "3. **Dimensionality reduction**: The feature vector can be much smaller than the state space. For example, in a grid world with 1000000 \"states\", a well-designed feature vector might only have have 100 features.\n",
        "4. **Feature engineering**: We can design the feature vector to encode, _a priori_, domain knowledge about the environment. For example:\n",
        "    - In a RL task where the inputs are words, we should encode the words as word embeddings (aka. feature vectors). It would be sensible to encode similar words as similar vectors for example \"cat\" and \"feline\" should be close in the feature space. Anything we then learn about \"cat\" should quickly generalise to \"feline\".\n",
        "    - In the grid world we might use states features which are continuous in space (e.g. smooth place cells). That way if we learn that position $(x,y)$ is good we can quickly generalise to $(x+\\delta_x, y+\\delta_y)$.\n",
